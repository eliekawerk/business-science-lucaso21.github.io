    "text": "The banking industry struggles with understanding and meeting the diverse needs of customers, resulting in generic marketing approaches to financial product offerings that fall short of creating personalized experiences. To address this challenge, a data-driven solution is required to effectively segment customers and create targeted personas for improved customer engagement and satisfaction, thus leading to increased revenue for banks/financial institutions.\n\n\nCustomer segmentation can be achieved through the powerful k-means algorithm. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques, financial institutions (banks & credit card companies) gain valuable insights into customer behavior, preferences, and characteristics. This enables the identification of distinct customer segments and the development of personalized offerings. This has several advantages including enhanced customer understanding, improved customer engagement with product offerings, a healthier customer base, and increased revenue for financial institutions.\n\n\n\nTo implement customer segmentation and using the k-means algorithm, financial institutions should follow these steps: 1. Data Collection and Integration: Gather customer data from various sources, including transaction records, demographic information, and customer interactions. 2. Preprocessing and Feature Selection: Cleanse and preprocess the data, selecting relevant features for analysis, such as transaction frequency, average balance, age, and customer preferences. 3. K-Means Clustering: Apply the k-means algorithm to segment customers based on similar behavioral patterns. Determine the optimal number of clusters and assign customers to their respective segments. 4. Persona Creation: Develop personas for each customer segment, incorporating demographic information, behaviors, preferences, and goals. These personas should be representative of the segment’s characteristics and serve as a guide for targeted marketing strategies. 5. Implementation and Iteration: Implement personalized marketing campaigns and track the performance of the tailored strategies. Continuously evaluate and refine the segments and personas based on customer feedback and evolving market dynamics.

    "section": "5.1 K-Means Algorithm",
    "text": "5.1 K-Means Algorithm\nK-Means algorithm is a popular unsupervised machine learning technique used for clustering data. The algorithm works by dividing a set of data points into k clusters based on their similarity. Initially, k centroids are chosen randomly from the data points, and each data point is assigned to the nearest centroid. Then, the centroids are moved to the center of their respective clusters, and the data points are re-assigned to the nearest centroid. This process is repeated until the centroids no longer move or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe k-means algorithm is widely used in various applications, such as customer segmentation, and anomaly detection. To learn more about the k-means algorithm, you can read up on the following sources:\n\nK-Means Clustering.\nBenefits & challenges of k-means for customer segmentation\nHow to use k-means clustering for customer segmentation\n\nBefore proceeding with k-means clustering, I decided to filter the dataset down to a particular cohort of customers, in order to ease computational time and ease of analyzing/visualizing clusters. I’ll be picking customers with tenure at 10 months for my analysis cohort. This cohort has 236 customers and makes up 2.6% of the dataset.\n\n5.1.1 Data Prep\nTo prepare the dataset for k-means clustering, I performed the following steps:\n\nCreate an analysis cohort by filtering for customers with tenure = 10.\nDrop any rows with null values. This leaves an analysis cohort of 226 customers.\nCreate a credit_utilization feature by dividing balance by credit_limit.\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Feature Engineering\nFeature engineering is an important step in preparing data for k-means clustering. I used the following techniques for feature engineering in order to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the algorithm:\n\nRemove unwanted features - Remove the cust_id column. This is not needed for k-means and is used only as a customer identifier. I also make the executive decision to remove the installment_purchases column. This feature is defined as the “amount of purchases done in installments”. I would assume that purchases is the important feature in this dataset and regardless of the number of purchase installments.\nNormalization - This step scales each feature to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. This helps prevent features with larger values from dominating the clustering results.\nDimensionality Reduction (PCA) - Reducing the dimensionality of the data can reduce the computational complexity and improve the interpretability of the clustering results. A popular dimensionality reduction technique is called PCA (Principal Component Analysis). PCA works by identifying a smaller number of variables, known as principal components, that can explain the maximum amount of variance in the original dataset. These principal components are linear combinations of the original variables, and each one represents a different direction in the data. The first principal component captures the most variance in the data, while each subsequent component captures as much of the remaining variance as possible. For a video explanation of how PCA works, see this link.\n\nSetting a PCA threshold of 80%, meaning generating enough components to capture 80% of the variability in the features, PCA identified 5 principal components from 16 features. See sample below;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Optimal Number of Clusters\nTo determine the optimal number of clusters, we can use a Skree Plot. A skree plot is used to determine the appropriate number of clusters to use in a k-means clustering analysis. The skree plot displays the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) on the y-axis, plotted against the number of clusters on the x-axis.\nThe within-cluster sum of squares measures the total squared distance between each point and it’s assigned cluster center, summed over all clusters. The scree plot helps identify the elbow point, or the point on the plot where adding more clusters does not significantly improve the clustering performance, i.e., the WCSS is not significantly reduced by adding more clusters.\nThe elbow point is typically used as a guide for deciding how many clusters to retain in the analysis. However, there is no hard and fast rule for selecting the number of clusters, this can be based on domain knowledge and knowledge about the dataset. The plot below is the skree plot for our analysis cohort;\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: We can see that the elbow point appears to be 5 clusters. However after running the first iteration of the k-means algorithm, I noticed that only 1 customer (cust_id C11004) was being assigned to cluster 1. I would assume that this customer has certain characteristics that stand out for the rest of the cohort. For this particular analysis, I just decided to exclude this customer and re-cluster again, using 4 clusters."

In order to visualize the cluster assignments, I used UMAP for the sole purpose of generating x and y axis coordinates for visualizing clusters. Recall our dataset for k-means was reduced to 5 principal components. I wanted to still be able to visualize the clusters in 2 dimensions.\nThe plot below shows our cluster assignments from the k-means algorithm;\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: Although not perfect, the k-means algorithm does a decent job of segmenting customers. We can see 4 distinct segments with a few customers that should probably be re-clustered, although a 3 dimensional plot may present a different perspective."

    "text": "5.3 Cluster Analysis\nNow that we have our clusters of customers, we can begin analyzing these clusters to understand trends in customer characteristics of the different clusters. Note that we have already seen some of these trends during the explanatory data analysis phase, thus we can better understand how the k-means algorithm is working. To start, we can plot the distribution of some features of interest by cluster using boxplots. Let’s start by plotting the distribution of balance, cash_advance, credit_utilization and purchases.\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: Looking at the plot above, 2 distinct clusters stand out at first glance, cluster 4 and cluster 2:\n\nCluster 4: Include customers with high balance, cash_advance and credit_utilization. However, these customers have very low purchases. As we outlined earlier, these are customers that appear to be using their credit cards as a means to take out loans.\nCluster 2: Includes customers with high credit_utilization, slightly high balance and high purchases. These customers appear to be using their credits strictly for making purchases, and tend to pay off the balance frequently.\nCluster 3: These customers have lower values for all these features. However we know that this analysis cohort includes customers with tenure of 10 months, so these customers have had their credit cards for a while. This clusters appears to include customers who are cautious about using their credit cards and tend to make some low value purchases.\nCluster 1: These customers are similar to those in cluster 2, however they tend to have higher credit utilization. These customers appear to have much lower credit_limit (median of $2,500) compared to cluster 1 ($5,000) and cluster 3 ($3,500). Cluster 2 has the lowest median credit_limit ($1,350).\n\nLet us take a look at a few other feature distributions for our clusters. Below I show boxplots for credit_limit, minimum_payments, payments and purchase_trx for each cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: Once again we can gleam a few insights:\n\nCluster 4: Appears to have higher credit_limit and also, customers in this cluster tend to make make higher minimum payments, suggesting that some of these customers (who are using their credit cards to take out loans) are indeed making efforts to pay off their balance.\nCluster 2: These customers have high the highest purchase_trx but also have payments,\nminimum_payment, credit_limit and similar to clusters 1 and 4. These customers while making frequent purchases with their credit tend to pay just the minimum required payments and thus always maintain some balance on their credit card.\nClusters 1 and 3: These customers appear to have similar characteristics and maintain low levels of use for their credit cards."

    "text": "5.4 Customer Persona / Product Recommendations\nBased on the analysis in the previous section. We can thus create customer personas and come up with product recommendations to be marketed to these customers. We’ll do this using the following format; Cluster, Persona Name, Description, Stats, Product Recommendations.\n\nCluster 4: Loanee Customer\n\nDescription: These customers tend to use their credit cards a means for taking out loans. They use their credit card to bridge the gap between their financial needs, thus resulting in high cash advances, high balance and high credit utilization.\nStats: Range (medium - max).\n\nCredit Utilization - 65% - 97% (High)\nCash Advance - $3,431 - $11,221 (High)\nPurchases - $0 - $1,168 (Low)\nBalance - $2,701 - $9,560 (High)\n\nProduct Recommendations:\n\nBalance Transfer Card Options: Option to transfer their balance to 0% APR cards to save on interests rates.\nDebt Consolidation / Personal Loans: Provide debt consolidation loans with lower interest rates, allowing these customers to combine their high-interest debts into a single manageable payment, thus reducing their interest charges and simplifying their repayment strategy.\nCredit Counselling: Provide guidance on managing debt, creating budgets and financial improvements.\nCredit Builder Loans: Credit builder loans are specifically designed to help individuals build/improve their credit scores. Such loans are secured by the borrower’s savings account and timely payments are reported to the credit bureaus. These loans benefit both the financial institution through interest earned and also benfit the customer by establishing/rebuiliding positive credit history.\n\n\nCluster 2: Purchasing Customer\n\nDescription: These customers use their credit cards as a means for making frequent purchases. This may be due to the convenience and rewards earned by using their credit cards.\nStats: Range (medium - max).\n\nCredit Utilization - 35% - 93% (Medium to High)\nCash Advance - $49 - $4,161 (Low to High, excluding outliers)\nPurchases - $1,813 - $4,924 (High)\nBalance - $365 - $4,279 (Low to Medium)\n\nProduct Recommendations:\n\nRewards Programs: Reward programs where customers earn points, cashback, or airline miles based on their spending. These programs encourage customers to use their credit cards and provide incentive for loyalty.\nPremium Cards: This bank could offer premium cards with enhanced benefits for frequent users. While these cards typically come with higher annual fees (value for the bank), they also provide additional perks such as airport lounge access, concierge services, travel insurance, etc. (value for the customer).\nInstallment Plans: This bank could offer installment plans to these customers, enabling them to convert larger purchases in smaller, more manageable monthly payments.\nCredit Lines / Lower Interest Rates: Frequent card users who have established positive credit history could be eligible for increased credit lines and lower interest cards.\n\n\nCluster 3: Prudent Customer\n\nDescription: These customers take a cautious and thoughtful approach to their credit card usage. They have a sense of responsible financial behavior and consider their spending decisions carefully.\nStats: Range (medium - max).\n\nCredit Utilization - 4% - 52% (Low to Medium, excluding outliers)\nCash Advance - $0 - $1,465 (Low to Medium)\nPurchases - $460 - $3,431 (Low to Medium)\nBalance - $70 - $1,393 (Low to Medium)\n\nProduct Recommendations:\n\nLow Interest Cards: Offer credit cards with low annual percentage rates (APRs). These cards offer a lower cost of borrowing, allowing customers to manage their balances with minimal interest charges. Banks benefit from interest earned, while customers can maintain their cautious approach without worrying about excessive interest fees.\nSecured Credit Cards: Secured credit cards are an option for customers who want to build or rebuild their credit while maintaining control over their spending. These cards require a security deposit as collateral, which sets the credit limit. This offers an opportunity for cautious customers to establish a positive credit history while banks benefit from the security deposit and the potential to convert customers to unsecured credit cards in the future.\nFraud Protection and Monitoring: Banks can provide enhanced fraud protection and monitoring services for cautious customers. These services include real-time transaction alerts, identity theft protection, and advanced security features to safeguard against fraudulent activities. Customers gain peace of mind knowing that their accounts are closely monitored and protected, while banks can reduce the risk of financial losses due to fraud.\n\n\nCluster 1: Selective Customer\n\nDescription: These customers also have a careful and deliberate approach to credit card usage, primarily for low/medium value infrequent purchases. They are selective in their spending choices and prioritize making low/medium value purchases rather than frequent small transactions.\nStats: Range (medium - max).\n\nCredit Utilization - 13% - 98% (Low to High)\nCash Advance - $60 - $3,980 (Low to Medium)\nPurchases - $95 - $1,810 (Low to Medium)\nBalance - $365 - $4,279 (Low to Medium)\n\nProduct Recommendations:\n\nValue Purchase Financing: Banks can offer specialized financing options for infrequent purchases, allowing customers to pay for these purchases over time with low or 0% interest rates. This benefits customers by providing affordable installment plans and flexibility in managing their cash flow, while banks generate interest revenue and foster customer loyalty.\nExtended Warranty Protection: Banks can provide extended warranty protection as an added benefit for customers making certain infrequent high-value purchases. This extends the manufacturer’s warranty of these high-value purchases, offering coverage against unexpected repairs or replacements, providing peace of mind to customers. The bank benefits from increased card usage and customer satisfaction, potentially leading to long-term loyalty.\nPersonalized Spending Insights: Banks can offer personalized spending insights and analysis for customers who make infrequent purchases. This includes detailed transaction categorization, spending trends, and recommendations tailored to their unique spending patterns. It benefits customers by helping them make informed financial decisions and optimize their spending, while banks enhance customer engagement and strengthen relationships by providing valuable financial insights.\n\n\n\nThese are just a few examples of how this bank can build customer personas from the various customer segments/clusters and market financial products to them. It is important that these financial products are mutually beneficial to both the bank and the customers.\nThe bank can test the success of these financial products through various ways including experimentation (a/b testing), surveys, user analytics, net promoter score (NPS), pilot programs, etc."
