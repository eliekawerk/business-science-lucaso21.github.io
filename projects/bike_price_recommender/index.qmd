# **Problem Statement**

In the competitive bike manufacturing industry, pricing strategies can significantly 
impact market share and profitability. A hypothetical bike manufacturer faces the 
challenge of setting prices that are competitive yet profitable, adapting to market 
demands without compromising margins. To stay competitive, the manufacturer needs 
a data-driven approach to dynamically adjust prices based on bike features and market trends.

# **Solution**

The solution proposed is an end-to-end analysis that leverages machine learning 
models to recommend a competitive pricing strategy. This approach utilizes a detailed 
dataset with features that influence bike pricing, coupled with advanced analytics 
to create a robust pricing model. The recommended strategy provides flexibility 
through multiple models to accommodate different pricing scenarios, from everyday 
competitive pricing to strategic markups and markdowns.

## **Implementation**

* **Data Collection:** Data was gathered through web scraping from 
the [Trek bikes](https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/) website, ensuring a rich 
dataset for analysis.

::: {.callout-note title="Web Scraping"}
Web-scraping script available 
[here](https://github.com/LucasO21/bike_pricing_recommender/blob/main/R/00_web_scraping.R).
:::

* **Feature Engineering:** Bike attributes such as model, year, frame material, 
and additional features like electrical components and shock presence were encoded. 
Keywords indicative of special features and parts manufacturers were also extracted 
to enrich the dataset.

::: {.callout-note title="Data Prep"}
Data prep script available 
[here](https://github.com/LucasO21/bike_pricing_recommender/blob/main/R/01_data_preparation.R).
:::

* **Model Development:** Four machine learning models were chosen for price prediction: 
RANDOM FOREST, XGBOOST, GLMNET (Linear Regression), and MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines).
Model Training and Validation: Each model was trained using the prepared dataset, 
validated, and its pricing predictions were compared to actual prices to gauge competitiveness.

* **Strategy Formulation:** The RANDOM FOREST model was designated as the standard 
"every day" pricing model due to its accurate price predictions. The XGBOOST model
was chosen for price markups given its higher price points, while the GLMNET and 
MARS models were selected for markdown scenarios due to their lower price predictions.
Deployment:

::: {.callout-note title="Modeling"}
Modeling script available 
[here](https://github.com/LucasO21/bike_pricing_recommender/blob/main/R/02_modeling.R).
:::

* **Deployment:** A user-friendly shiny app was developed to deploy the analysis. 
The app allows users to select bike specifications and select a pricing model to 
receive price recommendations.
